*Experiments with OpenGL and GLSL, mostly using C# and OpenTK*

This project includes mixed OpenGL and GLSL projects that can be used to learn more about how OpenGL works as exposed to the developer. The first class, ColoredTriangle, is an example of the interactions between colors and point positions as shown with an OpenGL triangle. It utilizes keyboard input from OpenTk to select different points, move their positions, and change their colors. R, G, and B on the keyboard select the different color elements of the selected point, which is changed with the spacebar. The positions of the points can be changed with the arrow keys.
